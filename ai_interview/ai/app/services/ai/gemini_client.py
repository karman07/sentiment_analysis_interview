        - Number the question_ids sequentially starting from 1.
        - The overall_score in summary should be out of 100. IMPORTANT: Do NOT simply take the mathematical average of individual question scores.
        - The overall_score should be a holistic assessment of the candidate's readiness for the role.
        - Prioritize core technical skills and problem-solving over greetings or simple introductory questions.
        - If the candidate performed exceptionally on difficult topics but missed minor points, the overall_score should reflect that high level of skill.
        - Conversely, if the candidate failed core role requirements from the JD, the overall_score should reflect that lack of readiness, even if they answered other questions correctly.
        - Each individual question score should be out of 10.

        - For the IMPROVEMENT PLAN, you MUST provide:
            1. immediate_actions: Things to do in the next 24-48 hours.
            2. 1_week_plan: Focused study and practice for the next 7 days.
            3. 1_month_plan: Longer-term skill development for the next 30 days.
        - You MUST populate EVERY SINGLE FIELD in the JSON schema. Do not leave any field as null or empty unless the schema explicitly allows it (and even then, prefer providing data).
